# Wheels-control-using-QS-909-JYQD-driver
In this repository, i used QS-909 JYQD motor driver with motor hall sensor input and arduino uno to control the robot wheel.

## What is QS-909 JYQD motor driver
Its a motor driver with direction and speed control, used to control brushless motor. It use 12 - 36V, up to 500W (you need heat sink for more than 60W). comes in two variants: 1) with motor hall sensor input and 2) sensorless.

### Here i used this version (with motor hall sensor)
